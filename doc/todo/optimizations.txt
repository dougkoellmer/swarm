- make it so that thread local blob cache remembers null results.

- optimize cell parse algorithm, test that it's faster, and pull some things out into a utility method to avoid heap allocation in some situations.

- find some way to share splash error message between noscript and caja init failure

- currently cell code is sent back from server and has to be parsed into json...theoretical bottleneck here for large amounts of text, and perhaps unnecessary...is there a better way? ideal would be that the server response is just a block of text that can be inserted right into the DOM
