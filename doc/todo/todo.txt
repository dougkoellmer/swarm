- decommission URI policy and API when leaving cell.

- load testing

- have "auto-run my cells" flag in user management, or any other way for users to fix DoS problems in their code.

- fix ie 10 text field focus bug

- figure out what caja mitigating is.

- make sure cell buffer isn't getting updated twice while dragging

- have a link to sandbox while inside the examples page.

- test performance improvement if removing loading animation

- create a bare bones log in/out servlet

- get new caja version...might require api changes...using "frame" instead of caja instance for taming.

- handle "unlimited character case", at least in code editor UI, for number of characters left...actually, elsewhere too



- have an alert bring focus to the cell such that the user can press the enter button and dismiss the alert.

- account for multiple syncs coming back out of order...currently just blocks until last one is complete.

- get touch/drag working for zoom slider and panel resizer

- add pinch/zoom to cell grid (may have to disable mouse for more than one touch).

- have seperate preview buttons for "compiled" and "splash", perhaps

- have "are you sure" for both signing out, and exiting page, for unsaved changes...make sure it disregards changes to sandbox cell

- make it so that enter, anywhere in the tab order of the sign up/in panel, causes the appropriate sign in/up call to fire?

- have a simple boolean that censors a cell's content

- be able to sign in with username, maybe

- in dev mode, first key press in a text field doesn't register...after that, fields owrk normally...not a problem in release

- build up a "mitigate library" so users can load shared scripts from b33hive without having to cajole them (if that's how mitigate works).

- have an automatic "taken" check for username, and maybe e-mail, as they're typing it




- consider https if other similar Show HNs have it.

- checkbox to create cell or not...in manage account, have "claim cell" if user doesn't have one...might have a "confirm" dialog to dissuade casual users.

- have way to change user name

- wiggle account input fields when there's an error after pressing the sign in/up button
