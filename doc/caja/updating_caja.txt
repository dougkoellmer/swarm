- svn up in caja trunk

- ant in caja trunk

- might see bunch of errors complaining about exceptions and such...should be fine

- server-side caja jars are in ant-jars

- cilent-side js is in /home/dougk16/trunk/ant-lib/com/google/caja/plugin

- mount shared folder by using sudo mount -t vboxsf linux_share linux_share

- copy past jars and js into linux_share

- VERY IMPORTANT...remove all caja-related jar files from the build path, then delete, all inside eclipse, not in windows

- re-add jar files by dragging and dropping them into the WEB-INF/lib, again, in eclipse

- now re-add jars to build path

- js is all in a flat directory in the blah/blah/plugin folder in the caja svn repo, but for some reason when using caja in a webpage, caja.js has to be in a folder all itself, with a subfolder in the same directory whose name is the svn revision number *shrug*

- make sure the two wrapping divs around a caja widget have their style/class set correctly by looking at the two divs wrapping a widget initialized with JS
